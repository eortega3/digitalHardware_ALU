Project 05 - ALU

3. Project Overview:  Based on a signal f we are expected to preform several 
			arithmetic operators. Such as OR, AND, XOR, NOR, addition, 
			subtraction, and LESS THAN.  This is based on an ALU
			which is a piece of arithmatic compuatational circuitatry
			which is used in common computer archecture. After
			programming the cases for each input of signal f we
			obtained the flags which would have been either 1 or
			0 based on operation. From here we operated the different
			operators in the csv file which was changed to our test
			vector file.  These test vectors were read into the test
			bench to test each case of each operator in easy
			succussion.  This would be done on modelsim through
			simulating the testbench which ran the ALU.

6. (Optional) Comments:  The reason this took me so long was because of the reading in of the bits and how to properly display/assign them.
